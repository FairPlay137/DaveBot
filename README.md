# DaveBot - A fun, Davemadson-themed chatbot for Discord

This is DaveBot. What is DaveBot, you ask? Well, DaveBot is a Discord chatbot which is generally used for fun. However, the original code was a mess and was generally amateurish. That codebase is referred to as DaveBot Legacy, whose source code *may* be published in the not-too-distant future as an archive of what DaveBot used to be.

## New features (not part of the original DaveBot Legacy or PaletteBot codebases)

* (TBD)

## Features that have been ported over already

* The `db!ship` command

## Features that have yet to be ported over

* Most of the davemadson-related commands (`db!davemadson`, `db!ltbloopers`, `db!funnysigns`, etc.)
* The davemadson activity notifications
* The other davemadson-themed fun commands (`db!crotchkick`, `db!fire`, `db!wedgie`, etc.)

## Planned new features

* Ability to customize the davemadson activity notifications
* More fun commands
* More voice channel commands
