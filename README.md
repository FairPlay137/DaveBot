# DaveBot - A fun, Davemadson-themed chatbot for Discord

This is DaveBot. What is DaveBot, you ask? Well, DaveBot is a Discord chatbot which is generally used for fun. However, the original code was a mess and was generally amateurish. That codebase is referred to as DaveBot Legacy, whose source code will be published in the not-too-distant future as an archive of what DaveBot used to be.
