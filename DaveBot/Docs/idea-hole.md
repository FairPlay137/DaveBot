# The Idea Hole

Ideas for the rewrite will end up here. Most of them will come from the DaveBot Central Discord server.
Got any ideas for the public DaveBot? Go to the DaveBot Central server! Note that the public DaveBot's reactions will not be in the self-hostable version of DaveBot. However, the commands will.

* Sam's signature laugh line, "Hahahahahahahahahahah soi soi soi soi rofl rofl rofl rofl!" will result in the reaction "**NOT FUNNY!**" (Suggested by SnakeSpiderScorpion on the DaveBot Central Discord server)
* db!randomtantrum (I've actually had plans for this during the DaveBot Legacy days, but I wasn't sure what to put in there.)
* HIDDEN COMMAND:  db!shitallover [Target] - Causes Lucifer and/or Lucretia McEvil, a scary logo, Vulcanna Ash, or any other antagonist to shit all over the target. (Suggested by SnakeSpiderScorpion on the DaveBot Central Discord server)
* db!clean [target] = Welcome to God’s country, [target]. Time for you to be scrubbed clean. (Suggested by SnakeSpiderScorpion on the DaveBot Central Discord server)
